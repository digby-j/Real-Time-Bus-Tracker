# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Realtime Bus Tracker using Asynchronous calls, JavaScript, API the DOM, and other technologies to simulate real time bus tracking

## Introduction

Using Asynchronous Programming Techniques, grids, DOM and multiple APIs, one can simulate bus tracking in the browser. Utilising API from Mapbox, we can display a map in browser. On top of that, using API from MBTA - Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority we can extrapolate bus routes for our use case. Using Asynchronous Programming Techniques we can query the API from MBTA witout getting blocked by the provider. We can then extrapolate this data and track a marker accross Longitude and Latitude with the DOM.

2. Navigate to that direcotry and open file: "index.html" in your browser of choice.
3. Once loaded, click the button in the top right to watch the marker move along the bus route.

## Road Map

I would like to take the locations from the API as opposeed to keeping it in the script..
